# DataSync

This project implements a distributed file system where clients interact with a central server that manages the storage and retrieval of files across multiple specialized servers. Clients connect to the central server to perform various file operations, while the central server handles the distribution of files to the appropriate servers based on file type. The system supports multiple clients simultaneously, with the central server managing the processes and communication needed to ensure files are stored and retrieved efficiently from the correct locations.
